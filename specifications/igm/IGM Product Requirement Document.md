## 1. Overview

The Issue & Grievance Management (IGM) for ONDC is a mechanism via which issues between users of the network are resolved. The IGM flow has been developed based on the Issue & Grievance Management which acts as a facilitator to resolve issues and disputes between a Complainant and Respondent in a manner that ensures transparency, fairness and data security to the parties. The framework is built on the interactions on a tripartite Network Participants (NPs) contract for a unique transaction including logistics services by Logistics Service Provider (LSP) that has been procured on-network. This implies that a complainant shall be raising an issue for a particular transaction on the network which may involve buyer app, seller app, logistics service provider app or any other participants as may be notified by ONDC as identified entities for a given transaction.
