Protocol Layered Architecture
ONDC is an ambitious initiative to democratize digital commerce by creating a decentralized network of buyer apps and seller apps through an interoperable protocol specification. ONDC Protocolâ€™s layered architecture is illustrated as shown in the diagram below. The base layer refers to the Beckn Protocol which is an open source decentralized protocol. Over the base layer, the network extension layer comprises the API contracts customised to the ONDC context along with other specs that have been adopted in order to facilitate transactions in the network.<br>
